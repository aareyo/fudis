# Ways of working

<br />

## Naming convensions

The Fudis Design System uses the following naming conventions described here. These conventions aim to reduce the load of creating new names for components while maintaining a consistent project folder structure.

### Prefix

Fudis uses selector prefix **fudis**. Prefix prevents collision with consumers existing design tokens.

### CSS/SASS class names

Fudis follow BEM methodology of block, element and modifier.

<br />

### Fudis components

---

- **fudis** -prefix
- All lower case
- Segments are joined with <code>-</code>.

#### Example `fudis-text-input`

- **fudis** -prefix
- **Block level:** refers to a category. Ex. text.
- **Element:** Item type, ex. input.

<br />

### Fudis foundations - design tokens

---

#### Example `$fudis-spacing-xs`

- **fudis** -prefix
- **Block level:** refers to a type: focus, border, grid, breakpoint.
- **Element:** Refers to a specific item. Ex. heading, body, form-field.
- **Modifier:** Describes the quality of the identifier, like width, state or a variant.

<br />

## Styles

It’s a good practice to reuse components, while preventing rewriting their existing .scss styles

- Component inline styles should be avoided. This allows full control over component styles through variables.

  > Exceptions exist, e. g. [GridComponent](?path=/story/components-grid--grid) which dynamically applies @Input values to CSS grid without need to write tens of helper CSS classes.

- Components styles should be recorded in their own .scss file directly in their own folder.
- Use globally defined colors, spacing, etc. rather than introducing hard-to-maintain local values.

### Styling conventions should follow BEM structure.

- **Block:** fudis-radio-button
- **Element:** fudis-radio-button\_\_indicator
- **Modifier:** fudis-radio-button\_\_indicator–invalid

In order to keep styling consistent in and between components, it’s important to use tokens through mixins. Stylelint will warn you, if styles do not follow this pattern. By this it’s possible to maintain an 8 px base system etc.

Avoid using style override `!important`.

### Angular Material styles

#### Theming

- Start applying themes to a Fudis component by using Material's theming API to make sure our custom theme is complete with regards to the component you are working on.
  - This provides style safety for your component and the whole library by having a more complete theme to fallback on whenever component-specific styling comes short.
  - **Do not** try to achieve too specific effects – _theme is a global high-level definition of styles!_
- After exhausting your options to style a component via theming, apply component-level styles.

- - _**It's recommended Not to override or modify Angular Material's CSS or DOM!**_ This will make upstream minor and patch changes potentially breaking changes for Fudis.

- All ngMaterial style changes are documented in themes folder `ngMaterialCustomisation.scss `.
