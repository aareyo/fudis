# Component checklist

<br />

## 1. Component is imported and exported correctly

- #### Ngx-fudis.module.ts

  `fudis/ngx-fudis/projects/ngx-fudis/src/lib/ngx-fudis.module.ts`
  **→ Import, Declaration, Export**

- #### Public-api.ts

  `fudis/ngx-fudis/projects/ngx-fudis/src/public-api.ts`
  **→ Export**

- #### App.module.ts
  For Angular Material component module Dev import.
  `fudis/ngx-fudis/projects/dev/src/app/app.module.ts`
  **→ Import**
- #### .stories.ts

  Import each component in their own .stories file.
  If component uses Angular Material component as a base, import Angular component module in the beginning of story and declare it in moduleMetadata decorators.
  **→ Import**

```

Decorators: [
	moduleMetadata({
		imports: [´name of Angular module`],
	}),
],

```
