## Form component stories

<br />

Form components need test data in order to work properly in Storybook. These components require a "test components" documented in their story. This test component is only for the use of that particular story and they will not be exported as a part of the library.
The use of separate test component enables [Angular formControls](https://angular.io/api/forms/FormControl) to be used within the story.

### Example: Radio Button group component
