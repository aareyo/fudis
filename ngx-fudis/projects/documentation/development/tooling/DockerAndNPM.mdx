# Docker and NPM (Node.js)

The development environment for Fudis is implemented with Docker and NPM (Node.js). Any fairly recent version should work. However, it is recommended to use the Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file in repository root. Correct Node.js version is important, e.g. when installing or updating NPM packages.

Running the development environment does not require installing NPM packages locally. However, your IDE tooling most likely does (simply run `npm ci` in repository root).

`npm start` spins up Storybook and `npm stop` shuts it down. See [Command Reference](/docs/documentation-development-command-reference--documentation) for more.
