# Development Environment

The development environment for Fudis is implemented with Docker and NPM (Node.js). Any fairly recent version should work. However, it is recommended to use the Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file in repository root. Correct Node.js version is important, e.g., when installing or updating NPM packages.

Running the development environment does not require installing NPM packages locally. However, your IDE tooling most likely does (Simply run `npm ci` in repository root.)

`npm start` spins up Storybook and `npm stop` shuts it down. See [Command Reference](/docs/documentation-development-command-reference--documentation) for more.

## Manual Release

Read how to create new release with automated script from [Creating a Release](/docs/documentation-development-creating-release--documentation) documentation.

This is not advised, but if you need to create the release manually

1. Bump versions in all `package.json` files
2. Create a version tag
3. Push changes to GitHub

Basically `npm version` modified to run in sub-directories:

```bash
npm version <major|minor|patch>
```
