# Getting Started with Fudis Development

This document contains information for installing and running tools needed for Fudis development.

## Set up Local Repository

Clone the upstream repository from [Fudis Design System](https://github.com/funidata/fudis.git):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/funidata/fudis.git
```

You can also ignore the `gh-pages` branch to avoid syncing with it continuously (`cd` into your local repo first):

```bash
git config --add remote.origin.fetch '^refs/heads/gh-pages'
```

## Install Dependencies

In the root of project, install repository dependencies and Fudis dependencies.

```bash
npm install && cd ngx-fudis && npm install
```

## Build Application and Watch for Changes

All following command should be run from **the root** of the fudis repository.

> Build and watch for changes in Fudis package

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Start Storybook

> Start Storybook and open it in browser http://localhost:6600

```bash
npm run storybook
```

## Sandbox Application

> Open sandbox in browser http://localhost:4200

```bash
npm run sandbox
```

## Run Tests

This command will run unit tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## Formatting and Linting

Fudis uses Husky Git hooks to prevent unformatted code being pushed to GitHub.
To execute linting check separately, run following commands in the root of the repository:

```bash
npm run lint
```

and

```bash
npm run style-lint
```
