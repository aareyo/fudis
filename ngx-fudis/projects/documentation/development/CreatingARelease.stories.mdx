# Creating a Release

New versions are published to NPM using GitHub Releases. After tagging and creating a release on GitHub, an automatic workflow handles packaging and publishing Fudis to NPM.

## Versioning

Fudis uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

### Patch
Patch updates are interchangeable, meaning clients can upgrade or downgrade freely between versions.\
**Example:** Bug fix, interval tweak.

### Minor
Minor updates are compatible with previous versions and usually includes additional features.\
**Example:** New features, old features declared as deprecated.

### Major
Major changes are backward incompatible and will have breaking changes.\
**Example:** Changes in API endpoint name, remove of an endpoint.

## Release Pipeline

**Steps for creating a new release:**
- Create a new branch `release_v[version-number]`
	> Note! Make sure your local main branch is up to date when creating a new branch. This ensures you have all current commits before tagging a new release. Otherwise, if releasing from an existing branch, make sure to rebase onto current main before tagging
- Depending on the changes included in the release, run one of the following command `npm version <major|minor|patch>`
	> The command increments version number fields in `package.json` files, commits the changes, tags that commit as the new version, and pushes commits and tags to GitHub
- Go to project's GitHub main page **Releases**
- Select **Draft a new release**
- Select **Choose a tag**. Choose the newest generated version tag from a list
- If necessary choose from **Previous tag** dropdown, the version you want to compare to. Otherwise use default 'Previous tag: auto'
- Select **Generate release notes**
- Replace **What's Changed** heading with a current date
- Check from **Preview** that everything looks correct
- Check that **Set as the latest release** checkbox is selected
- Publish release
- Check that the npm package has [updated to latest version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@funidata/ngx-fudis)
- Merge created pull request

### Note!
If something goes wrong with the release, create a new patch version instead of trying to fix already published version. Overwriting released version might produce unwanted concequences with the work of other project developers.
