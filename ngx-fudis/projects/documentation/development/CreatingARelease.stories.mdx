# Creating a Release

## Versioning

Fudis uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

### Patch
Patch updates are interchangeable, meaning clients can upgrade or downgrade freely between versions.\
**Example:** Bug fix, interval tweak.

### Minor
Minor updates are compatible with previous versions and usually includes additional features.\
**Example:** New features, old features declared as deprecated.

### Major
Major changes are backward incompatible and will have breaking changes.\
**Example:** Changes in API endpoint name, remove of an endpoint.

## Release Pipeline

**Steps for creating a new release:**
* Create a new branch `release_v[version-number]`
* Depending on the changes included in the release, run one of the following command `npm version patch / minor / major`
	* `npm version` will automatically increment the version number in all project's package.json files
	* The action makes a git commit and a push, including git tag to a spesific version
* Go to project's GitHub main page 'Releases'
* Select 'Draft a new release'
* Select 'Choose a tag'. Choose the newest generated version tag from a list
* If necessary choose from 'Previous tag' dropdown, the version you want to compare to. Otherwise use default 'Previous tag: auto'
* Select 'Generate release notes'
* Replace 'What's Changed' heading with a current date
* Check from 'Preview' that everything looks correct
* Check that 'Set as the latest release' checkbox is selected
* Publish release
* Check that the npm package has [updated to latest version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@funidata/ngx-fudis)
* Merge created pull request

**Note!** \
If something goes wrong with the release, create a new patch version instead of trying to fix already published version. Overwriting released version might produce unwanted concequences with the work of other project developers.
