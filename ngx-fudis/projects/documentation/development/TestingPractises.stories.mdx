## E2E Testing with Screenshot Regression Tests

Cypress is used for E2E testing with Storybook examples of Fudis components, organisms, directives etc.

Primary reason for Cypress E2E tests are screenshot regression tests. These are used to catch, even pixel level bugs and other unwanted style changes in Fudis components.

### Running tests

- Start Storybook
- Run all tests with command `npm run cypress`
- To run a single test, in `ngx-fudis` folder use CLI command of e. g. `npx cypress run --spec 'cypress/e2e/components/button.cy.ts'`
