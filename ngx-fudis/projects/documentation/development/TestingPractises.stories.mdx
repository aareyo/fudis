# Testing Practises

## Unit Testing

Every component, directive, service and utility function in Fudis should have relevant unit tests. 
With this we want to ensure catching component's functionality errors when for example component's API changes. 

For unit tests Fudis uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and it is recommended to install [vscode-jest](https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest) extension.
After installed, Jest will run in the background for changed files and output can be found from Terminal tab (Jest).


## E2E Testing with Screenshot Regression Tests

Cypress is used for E2E testing with Storybook examples of Fudis components, organisms, directives etc.

Primary reason for Cypress E2E tests are screenshot regression tests. These are used to catch, even pixel level bugs and other unwanted style changes in Fudis components.
