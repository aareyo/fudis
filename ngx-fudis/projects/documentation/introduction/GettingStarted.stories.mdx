# Getting Started

Fudis Design System provides guidelines, design assets and components that work as the foundation for all of Funidata's products. The purpose of this Angular-based system is to support a sustainable and consistent development and accessible customer experience for our services.

## Intallation

You can find package information at NPM https://www.npmjs.com/package/@funidata/ngx-fudis

#### 1. Install Angular Material peer dependency:

```
ng add @angular/material

```

Choose these options when prompted:

<code>
	{' '}
	? Choose a prebuilt theme name, or "custom" for a custom theme: Custom <br /> ? Set up global Angular Material typography
	styles? No <br /> ? Set up browser animations for Angular Material? Yes
</code>

<br />

#### 2. Then install Fudis:

```
ng add @funidata/ngx-fudis

```

#### 3. Import Core Styles

The core styles from Angular Material must be imported in your application for the components to work properly. The easiest way to do this is to have a styles.scss file in project root with the following content:

```
@use "@angular/material" as mat; @include mat.core();

```

> Fudis does not include the Material core styles for you because **they should be included exactly once** in your application.

#### 4. Define applicationâ€™s primary colors as CSS variables in project root style

```
:root {
	--color-primary-light: #hex;
	--color-primary: #hex;
	--color-primary-dark: #hex;
	--color-primary-extra-dark: #hex;
}
```

#### Include Fudis foundation scss-file to your Angular settings

- TODO

#### 5. Use Fudis components in your project

```
import { ButtonComponent } from './button.component';

<fudis-button label="Eiku"></fudis-button>

```

or

```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
 selector: 'app-root',
 template: ` <fudis-button label="Eiku"></fudis-button> `,
 styleUrls: ['./app.scss'],
})
export class AppComponent {
 title = 'dev';
}


```
