# Validators

Fudis Form components uses FudisValidators that have following types: `required`, `email`, `minLength`, `maxLength`,`min`, `max` and `pattern`.

## Usage Guidelines


### Required validator

**required** error is shown if user input is required and
- if control is touched and
		- if control value is null

For required form field, include `FudisValidators.required()` in the form control validator with message parameter either as a string or as an observable string.

```
FudisValidators.required('This is required field')
```

---

### Email validator

Email validator expects that the related form field type is set to `[type]="'email'"`. Validator checks that the given input corresponds to the set email type of the form field. 
Validator takes a message parameter either as a string or as an observable string.

```
FudisValidators.email('Input must be an email address.')
```

---

### MinLength and MaxLength validators

**minLength** and/or **maxLength** errors are shown
- if control is touched and
	- if control value is not null and
		- if control value length does not match the given validators length

For minLength and maxLength, include `FudisValidators.minLength()` and `FudisValidators.maxLength()` in the form control validator with prefered input length as number and a message parameter as a string or as an observable string.
Max length validator does not prompt any error message but disable user to input more than allowed length of characters to the input field. 

```
FudisValidators.maxLength(20, 'Too long email.')
```
---

### Min and Max validators

**minNumber** and/or **maxNumber** errors are shown
	- if control is touched and
		- if control value is not null and
			- if control value is not respective to given **min** and/or **max** validator values

Min and Max validators are used with form field `[type]="'number'"` Min and Max validator disables inputs that exceeds over or fall below the allowed values.
Form components that use 
Error message is prompt, when the user inputs lower or higher values than the allowed value to the input field. 
Form components that include min/max validation reguire a validation number and message parameter as a string or as an observable string.

```
FudisValidators.max(10,'Given number is cannot exceed over 10.')

```
---

### Pattern validator

Pattern validator receives a Regex pattern and makes input comparison with the given pattern. 
Validator takes in a pattern as a string or with a type definition of Regex. Error message parameter is given as a string or as an observable string.

```
FudisValidators.pattern(/^[A-Z \d\W]+$/, 'PLEASE USE ONLY LOW CAPS!')

```
