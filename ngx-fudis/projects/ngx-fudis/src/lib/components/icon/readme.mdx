# Icon

Icons are rendered as <code>svg</code> elements.

## Examples

<Canvas of={IconStories.Icon}></Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

Icons have default size of 32x32px but icons with suffix **-small** (e. g. `alert-small`, `info-small`) are scaled to 16x16px.

Icons with suffix **-fill** (e. g. `alert-fill`, `info-circle-fill`) have their default style with white background. These icons **cannot** be colored with the `color` property.

Icons can be rotated 180°, 90° clockwise and 90° counterclockwise with `rotate` property.

#### Mandatory Properties

Fudis-icon component requires at least `icon`. Change the color through `color` property and rotate the icon with `rotate`.

### Accessibility

- Icons are always hidden from screen readers
	- Be cautious that no information is communicated only with icons
