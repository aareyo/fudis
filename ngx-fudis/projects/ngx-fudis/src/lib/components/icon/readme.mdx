# Icon

Icons are rendered as <code>svg</code> elements.

## Examples

<Canvas of={IconStories.Icon}></Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

Icons have default size of 32x32px but icons with suffix **-small** (e. g. `alert-small`, `info-small`) are scaled to 16x16px.

Icons with suffix **-fill** (e. g. `alert-fill`, `info-circle-fill`) have their default style with white background. These icons **cannot** be colored with the `color` property.

#### Properties

Fudis-icon component requires at least `icon` property. All available icons can be seen in All Icons story page.

Optionally change the color through `color` property: _attention, danger, default, light, primary, success_ or _white._

Flip and rotate the icon with `rotate` property: _flip-180, cw-90,_ or _ccw-90._

### Accessibility

- Icons are always hidden from screen readers
  - Be cautious that no information is communicated only with icons

## Properties

<ArgTypes of={IconComponent} exclude={iconExclude} />
