# Text Area

Basic Text Area component. 

Text Area can only be resized vertically, horizontal resizing is disabled to avoid layout breaking. Additional features include possibility to add tooltip to the label and maximum character indicator to the bottom right corner.

## Examples

<Canvas of={TextAreaStories.Examples}></Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

#### Mandatory Properties

Necessary properties for Text Area are `label` and `control`.

#### As a required form field

If Text Area is a required form field include `Validators.required` in the form control validators and include a `required` error message in the `errorMsg` property.

#### With minLength and maxLength validators

Text Area can have min and max length validators. 

For min length, include `Validators.minLength()` in the form control validators and include `minlength` error messages in the `errorMsg` property. 

Max length validator does not prompt any error message but disable user to input more than allowed length of characters to the input field. For max length, include `Validators.maxLength()` in the form control validators and pass wanted maxLength as an Input to the Text Area <code>[maxLength]="maxLength"</code>. This will also activate the maximum character indicator to the bottom right corner of the input.

### Error Handling

- **Required** error is shown if text Area is required and
  - if control is touched and
			- Text Area value is null
- **minLength** error is shown
	- if control is touched and 
		- if control value is not null and
			- if control value is not respective to given **minlength** validator value

### Accessibility

- Label and guidance are linked to the Text Area via id
- Screen reader is informed when maximum character length has 5 characters left and when maximum character count is reached
