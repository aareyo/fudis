# Common Features of Select & Multiselect

Select and Multiselect components share multiple common features which are inherited from internal non-public `SelectBaseDirective` and `InputBaseDirective` directives.

Most notable common API feature is choosing if component is either a regular dropdown or an autocomplete component filtering dropdown options according to user text input.

## Basic Form Component Attributes

### Label (Mandatory)

Label string describing selection to be made from the select dropdown options.

### Help Text

Additional help text string to provide additional description or instructions what user is expected to choose from the select's options.

### Size

Width of the component. Value can be string `xl`, `lg`, `sm` or `xs`. By default size is `lg`.

### Placeholder

Placeholder string text shown in the component, when it has no chosen value.

### Usage Example

Example using Select component, but same input attributes for as well with Multiselect Component with `<fudis-multiselect>` selector.

```
<fudis-select
  [label]="'Your favorite day of the week'"
  [helpText]="'Choose one of the seven available options.'"
  [size]="'md'"
  [placeholder]="'Your favorite day'"
>
...
</fudis-select>
```

## Autocomplete related features

### Autocomplete Boolean

When `autocomplete` is set to `true`, the input field of the component changes to a text input, where user can start typing. Dropdown list of options is filtered and only shows visible those options, where filter text is included in option's label.

### Autocomplete Clear Button Boolean

By default `autocompleteClearButton` is set a boolean `true`. When `true`, autocomplete input will display an icon button with a cross. This button is used to clear and empty the filter text string in the input. With Select Component this Clear Button will also set Form Control's value to `null`.

When `autocompleteClearButton` is set to `false`, the select with autocomplete works very similarly as select without autocomplete: dropdown options will instantly open up when user clicks or focuses the input.

### Example Usage

```
<fudis-select
  [autocomplete]="true"
  [autocompleteClearButton]="false"
  ...
>
...
</fudis-select>
```
