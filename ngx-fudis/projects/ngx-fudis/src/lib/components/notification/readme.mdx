# Notification

Notifications are often informative contextual notifications that cannot be clicked away. The colors currently used are yellow `variant: “warning”`, red `variant: “danger”`, green `variant: “success”` and blue `variant: “info”`. Yellow notification is used in notes. Red notification describes an error situation. Green indicates the possibility or success of some function. Blue, on the other hand, is a neutral guideline.

## Examples

<Canvas of={NotificationStories.AllVariants}></Canvas>

### Link notification

Notification component property `link` accepts href address as a string. This link address is shown as default link title, but it can be changed with optinal `linkTitle` property. When link referes to external site `externalLink` property should be set to true. This will add an external link icon with aria-label to the link.
