# Notification

Notifications are often informative contextual notifications that cannot be clicked away. Input property `variant` can have following values:

- Yellow `warning` notification is used in notes.
- Red `danger` notification describes an error situation
- Green `success` indicates the possibility or success of some function
- Blue `info`, on the other hand, is a neutral guideline.

## Examples

<Canvas of={NotificationStories.AllVariants}></Canvas>

### Link notification

Notification component property `link` accepts href address as a string. This link address is shown as default link title, but it can be changed with optinal `linkTitle` property. When link referes to external site `externalLink` property should be set to true. This will add an external link icon with aria-label to the link.
