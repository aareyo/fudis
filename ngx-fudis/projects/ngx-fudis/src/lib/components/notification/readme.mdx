# Notification

Notifications are often informative contextual notifications that cannot be clicked away. The colors currently used are yellow `variant: "warning"`, red `variant: "danger"`, green `variant: "success"` and blue `variant: "light"`. The most common color is yellow, which is used in notes. Blue and green contextual notifications are rare. Red notification describes an error situation and green the possibility/success of some function. Blue, on the other hand, is a neutral guideline.

## Examples

### Link notification

Notification component property `link` accepts href address as a string. When link referes to external site `externalLink` property should be set on true. This will add an external link icon to a link. It is recommended to use `externalLinkAriaLabel` in order describe link action to screen reader users.
