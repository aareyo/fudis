# Notification

Notifications are often informative contextual notifications that cannot be clicked away. Input property `variant` can have following values:

- Yellow `warning` notification is used in notes.
- Red `danger` notification describes an error situation
- Green `success` indicates the possibility or success of some function
- Blue `info`, on the other hand, is a neutral guideline.

## Examples

Given link is shown as default link title which can be modified with `linkTitle` property.
