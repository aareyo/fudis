# Footer

Fudis Footer is static component to be used as application's footer in the bottom of the page. It is designed to use [Fudis Link](/docs/components-link--link) components as its content. Through content projection it's easier for developers to change related links depending on the application.
By using directives `fudisFooterRight` and/or `fudisFooterLeft`, developers can determine which side of the footer links are displayed.
The only fixed element in Fudis Footer is Funidata logo with a link to Funidata's homepage.
This logo holds a mandatory image alt-text that can be changed with `logoAltText` when the application language changes.

<Canvas of={FooterComponentStories.Footer} />
