# Footer

Fudis Footer is static component to be used as application's footer in the bottom of the page. It is designed to use [Fudis Link](/docs/components-link--documentation) components as its content. Through content projection it's easier for developers to change related links depending on the application. By using directives `fudisFooterRight` and/or `fudisFooterLeft`, developers can determine which side of the footer links are displayed. The only fixed element in Fudis Footer is Funidata logo with a link to Funidata's homepage and translated alt text for screen readers.
