# Heading

Heading is essentially a header element which inherits Fudis font-family.

There are six header options available from **h1** to **h6** and seven size options from **xxl** to **xxs**.
In addition, default margin bottom can be modified if needed. Margin bottom uses Fudis spacing token sizes.

More information about spacing tokens can be found from [Foundations/Spacing](/docs/foundations-spacing--documentation)
