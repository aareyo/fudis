# Heading Component

Heading Component is essentially a heading HTML element which inherits Fudis font-family.

## Usage Guidelines

### Semantic HTML Heading Level and Visible Size

There are six heading options available from `1` to `6` and seven size options from `xxs` to `xxl`.

The `level` input property determines which HTML element component renders. With `level=1` component renders a `h1` element and with `level=2` a `h2` element and so on.

When no `size` input value is provided, all of the heading levels have default sizes, where heading level `1` defaults to size `xxl`, heading level `2` defaults to size `xl` etc. However, heading sizes are responsive and on mobile devices where screen size is less than [breakpoint('sm')](/docs/foundations-breakpoints--documentation#breakpoint-mixins) all of the headings are converted to a smaller heading sizes.

More information about typography can be found from [Foundations/Typography](/docs/foundations-typography--documentation)

## Examples

Note! When heading `size` is set, heading `level` does not have any effect to the size property, i.e `level` is only essential for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

Size is opted to be modified as wanted with `size` property as follows.

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.AllVariants}></Canvas>
