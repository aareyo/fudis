# Heading

Heading is essentially a header element which inherits Fudis font-family.

There are six header options available from **h1** to **h6** and seven size options from **xxl** to **xxs**.
All of the heading levels have default sizes, where heading level **h1** is equivalent to size **xxl**, heading level **h2** is equivalent to size **xl** etc. However, heading sizes are responsive and on mobile devices where screen size is less than
[breakpoint('sm')](/docs/foundations-breakpoints--documentation#breakpoint-mixins) all of the headings are converted to a smaller heading sizes. 

In addition, default margin bottom can be modified if needed. Margin bottom uses Fudis spacing token sizes.

More information about spacing tokens can be found from [Foundations/Spacing](/docs/foundations-spacing--documentation)

## Examples

Note! When heading `size` is set, heading `level` does not have any effect to the size property, i.e `level` is only essential for screen readers and other assistive technologies. 

Size is opted to be modified as wanted with `size` property as follows.

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.AllVariants}></Canvas>
