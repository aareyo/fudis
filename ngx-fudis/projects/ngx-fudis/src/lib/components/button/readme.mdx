# Button

Buttons are categorized based on their importance and functionality, i.e `primary`, `secondary` and `tertiary`.
It is important to use the correct variant of the button for the intended action and not to overuse them to avoid overwhelming the user.

There are three button sizes available: `medium`, `small` and `icon-only`.

## Examples

<Canvas>
	<Story id="components-button--all-variants"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Button with icon

Button has option for icon. Frequently used icons: <code>search</code>, <code>three-dots</code> and <code>delete</code>. Icon color is automatically set according to which button variant is in use.

Icon is only a visual indicator and it is always hidden from screen readers.

</Canvas>

### Button with icon only

Button can be without a visible label but use this variation sparingly. To hide visible label, include `labelHidden` property to the button component. When label is hidden, the label will be reflected to HTML `aria-label` attribute in order to communicate screen reader users about the button functionality.

### Accessibility

- Button uses primary-color variable (`--fudis-color-primary`) which is set in the root of the application. Make sure the application's primary-color contrast ratio meets WCAG AA and AAA levels.
  - Disabled button has static colors `#484848` and `#D4D4D4` with contrast ratio 6.2:1
- Button has visible focus state
- Disabled button can be focused. State is communicated for screen reader
- Button click can be triggered with keyboard <code>enter</code> and <code>space</code> key
- Label is a mandatory property to provide for a button. If needed button can be given additional `ariaLabel` property. If button has no visibile label and both `label` and `ariaLabel` are provided, then those values are both combined and reflected to `aria-label` HTML attribute.
