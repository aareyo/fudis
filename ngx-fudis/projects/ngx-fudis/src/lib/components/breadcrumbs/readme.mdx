# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs is essentially a navigation element.

## Example

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.Breadcrumbs}></Canvas>

```
<fudis-breadcrumbs [label]="'My Lego Collection'">
	<fudis-breadcrumbs-item [label]="'My Legos'" [url]="'/'"/>
	<fudis-breadcrumbs-item [label]="'Genre'" [url]="'/genre'"/>
	<fudis-breadcrumbs-item [label]="'Star Wars\u{2122}'" [url]="'/genre/star-wars'"/>
	<fudis-breadcrumbs-item [label]="'UCS Imperial Star Destroyer\u{2122}'" [url]="'/genre/star-wars/set-75252'"/>
</fudis-breadcrumbs-item>
```

## Usage Guidelines

Breadcrumbs organism is built using parent wrapper of Breadcrumbs Component `<fudis-breadcrumbs>` and adding Breadcrumbs Item Components `<fudis-breadcrumbs-item>` as its children.

### Breadcrumbs - Parent Component

Necessary properties for Breadcrumbs Component is `label`.

`label` is used as aria-label and it should describe the name of the section breadcrumbs consists from, e.g. _"My profile"_. Aria-label will automatically have a prefix _"Breadcrumbs: "_ which will be followed by the given label.

### Breadcrumbs Item - Child Component

Breadcrumbs Item has two mandatory properties: `label` and `url`. Label is the visible label and url is the actual url for the Angular router.

The last Breadcrumbs Item Component is always displayed as non-link and just plain text. This is achieved through CSS and doesn't require configuration from the app.

## Accessibility

- Breadcrumbs is a `nav` element containing `ul` list of Breadcrumbs Items
- Aria-label is mandatory and will give additional information about the breadcrumbs
- Each visible Breadcrumbs Item, except the last one, is a link
- The last visible list item has `aria-current="page"` attribute
