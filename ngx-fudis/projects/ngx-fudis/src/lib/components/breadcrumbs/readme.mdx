# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs is essentially a navigation element.

## Example

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.Breadcrumbs}></Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

#### Mandatory Properties

Necessary properties for Breadcrumbs Component are `links` and `label`.

`label` is used as aria-label and it should indicate in which breadcrumbs section user is, e.g. _"Shopping Cart"_. 
Aria-label will automatically have a prefix _"Breadcrumbs: "_ which will be followed by the given label. 

`links` is an array of FudisBreadcrumb objects with label and url properties.

```
FudisBreadcrumb {
 label: string;
 url: string;
}
```


### Accessibility
- Aria-label is mandatory and will give additional information about the breadcrumbs
- Each breadcrumb is a link
- Current page is communicated and its link is disabled
