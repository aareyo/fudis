# Link Directive

It is recommended to use [Link Component](/docs/components-link--documentation), which uses Link Directive under it's hood.
Link Component's API currently supports href and Angular Router.
When alternative routing method is required e. g. UIRouter, it is recommended to use `fudisLink` with HTML anchor element. This will apply Link Component's `color` and `size` properties to native HTML anchor element.
Link Directive doesn't support the use of `externalLink` property.

## Examples

<Canvas of={LinkDirectiveStories.Example}></Canvas>

```
    <a fudisLink href="#example" [color]="color" [size]="size">https://www.example.com</a>
```

## Properties

<ArgTypes of={LinkDirective} exclude={linkExclude} />
