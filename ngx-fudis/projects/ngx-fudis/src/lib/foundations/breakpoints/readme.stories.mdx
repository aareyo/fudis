# Breakpoint mixins

Load Fudis mixins and tokens to your file in your SCSS file with:

```
@use "@funidata/ngx-fudis" as fudis;
```

## Min-width mixin

When you are using the mixin `breakpoint('md')`, your styles will be applied from `$breakpoint-md` and up.

```
@include fudis.breakpoint($breakpoint){}
```

| $breakpoint                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------- |
| string value from breakpoint tokens map (_$breakpoints_) |

```
.my-element {
  @include fudis.breakpoint('md'){
    // Rules defined here apply from breakpoint 'md' and up
  };
}

```

## Max-width mixin

When you are using the mixin `breakpoint-max('md')`, your styles will be applied when viewport is smaller than `$breakpoint-md`.

```
@include fudis.breakpoint-max($breakpoint){}
```
