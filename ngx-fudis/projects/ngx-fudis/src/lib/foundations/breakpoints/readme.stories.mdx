# Breakpoint mixins

When using breakpoint mixins load them with `@use '../../../foundations/breakpoints/mixins.scss' as breakpoints;` to the component's .scss file.

The mixins are using only max-width, so when you are using the mixin **fudis-breakpoint('m')**, your styles will be applied from the medium breakpoint and down.

````
@include breakpoints.fudis-breakpoint($breakpoint)
````

| $breakpoint |
| ---- |
| string value from breakpoint tokens map (_$fudis-breakpoints_) |

````
@include breakpoints.fudis-breakpoint('s');	
````
