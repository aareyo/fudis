# Breakpoint mixins

When using breakpoint mixins load them with `@use '../path/to/foundations/breakpoints/mixins.scss' as breakpoints;` to the component's .scss file.

The mixins are using only min-width, so when you are using the mixin **breakpoint('m')**, your styles will be applied from the medium breakpoint and up.

```
@include breakpoints.breakpoint($breakpoint)
```

| $breakpoint                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------- |
| string value from breakpoint tokens map (_$breakpoints_) |

```
@include breakpoints.breakpoint('s');
```

# Breakpoint tokens and values they apply

Breakpoints are based on Bootstrap's breakpoint system, which Sisu application uses widely.
