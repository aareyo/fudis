# Breakpoint mixins

When using breakpoint mixins load them with `@use '../path/to/foundations/breakpoints/mixins.scss' as breakpoints;` to the component's .scss file.

The mixins are using only min-width, so when you are using the mixin **fudis-breakpoint('m')**, your styles will be applied from the medium breakpoint and up.

```
@include breakpoints.fudis-breakpoint($breakpoint)
```

| $breakpoint                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| string value from breakpoint tokens map (_$fudis-breakpoints_) |

```
@include breakpoints.fudis-breakpoint('s');
```

<hr />

# Breakpoint tokens and values they apply

Breakpoints are based on Bootstrap's breakpoint system, which Sisu application uses widely.
